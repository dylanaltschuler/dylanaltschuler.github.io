## Dylan J. Altschuler
NYU Courant - PhD Candidate

I am studying probability with particular focus on high-dimensional phenomena and random combinatorics. At NYU, I am fortunate to be advised by Jonathan Niles-Weed. Before NYU, I received a bachelor's degree in math from Princeton University. Expected graduation of 2023.
